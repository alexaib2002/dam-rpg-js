The game should be able to:

- Transition between maps: The player can move around the overworld, and travel between rooms.
- Random enemy spawn: If the player is inside an enemy spawn area, there's a possiblity of starting a fight against a random enemy.
- Fighting screen: A fight screen where the player can choose between attacking, defending against enemy's attacks, recovering health and fleeing.
- Giving a game over if the player dies.
